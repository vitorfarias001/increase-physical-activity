# Increase Physical Activity
In this project, I created the design solution for a hypothetical company where physical exercises are added. Where I have created a wireframe of a small design system that will include the components used in the test.



### Project Flow

The user receives a push notification to remind them to take their first active break of the day. The user opens the app and sees a popup to choose the amount of time they want the active break to take. It has the following options: 30 seconds 1 minute 5 minutes After the user selects the duration, he must choose between the following options to start the active break: Random View Arms Legs Whole Body When the user selects the category, it shows a screen where specifies the chosen category, a short description and a video box that will start showing the exercises. Once the video ends, a button will activate to confirm that the active pause is complete. Upon returning home, it offers the user the option of viewing a calendar where he can consult all his activity and the days he has completed with active breaks.

### Points that need to be considered

The age of the user personas is between 18 and 45 years old. The color palette has yet to be decided. Build a solution that can adapt to a color palette later. The designed frames need to be stretchable in widths so that they can be used with cellphone and tablet.
